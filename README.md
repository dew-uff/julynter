# Julynter

![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/dew-uff/julynter/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Julynter is a linter for Jupyter Notebooks that aims at improving their Quality and Reproducibility based on the following guidelines [1]:

- Use short titles with a restrict  charset (A-Z a-z 0-9 .-) for notebook  files and markdown headings for more detailed ones in the body.
- Pay attention to the bottom of the  notebook. Check whether it can benefit from descriptive markdown cells or can have code cells executed or removed.
- Abstract code into functions, classes, and modules and test them.
- Declare the dependencies in  requirement files and pin the versions of all packages.
- Use a clean environment for testing the dependencies to check if all of them are declared.
- Put imports at the beginning of notebooks.
- Use relative paths for accessing data in the repository.
- Re-run notebooks top to bottom  before committing.


This repository provides an extension for Jupyter Lab compose of two parts: a Python package named `julynter`
for the server extension and a NPM package named `julynter`
for the frontend extension.

## Requirements

* JupyterLab >= 2.0

## Install

Note: You will need NodeJS to install the extension.

```bash
pip install julynter
jupyter lab build
```

## Troubleshoot

Known issues:

### Linting list does not update

Sometimes Julynter does not update the linting list after an action. If it occurs, click on the notebook name in the Julynter tab to force a reload.

### External and global options are not recognized

Julynter loads settings from `.julynter/config.json` at the initialization of Jupyter Lab. For reloading it, click on the configuration icon, select `Project settings` in the top and click on `Load`.

User and Project Settings will not apply for existing notebooks that have their individual settings stored as metadata. For updating the settings of these notebooks, click on the configuration icon, select `Project settings` in the top, click on `Load`, select `Notebook settings` in the top, and click on `Save`.

### Some linting messages never appear

Julynter connects to the kernel to perform some checks. When it is not able to connect to kernel, it indicates "Kernel not found" in the status icon and it does not perform all the checks.

Currently, Julynter only supports the IPython kernel. If you are using a different kernel or programming language that you would like to be fully supported, please submit an issue. If your notebook is connected to a Python kernel, but Julynter still displays this status code, please submit an issue as well.

### Different results

Julynter sends a code to execute on the kernel after every code executed by the user. This code usually does not interfere with the results, since one cell produces a result that is independent from the other. However, it is technically possible to delay the output of a cell to the next cell (I noticed it in a bug related to matplotlib: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5568). If it occurs, the delayed output may be received by Julynter and it will not appear on the next cell. Since I only noticed this behavior on this bug, I will not try to fix it now, but if you find a different result in another situation, please submit an issue.

### Frontend extesion is not working

If you are seeing the frontend extension but it is not working, check
that the server extension is enabled:

```bash
jupyter serverextension list
```

### Server extension is installed and enables, but Julynter does not appear

If the server extension is installed and enabled but you are not seeing
the frontend, check the frontend is installed:

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```

If it is installed, try:

```bash
jupyter lab clean
jupyter lab build
```

## Contributing

Pull requests for bugfixes and new features are welcome! 

### Install

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Move to julynter directory

# Install server extension
pip install -e .
# Register server extension
jupyter serverextension enable --py julynter --sys-prefix

# Install dependencies
jlpm
# Build Typescript source
jlpm build
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension link .
# Rebuild Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
jupyter lab build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
jlpm watch
# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab
jupyter lab --watch
```

### Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall julynter
jupyter labextension uninstall julynter
```
